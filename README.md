## Overview
This Shiny application is designed to assist researchers in understanding the dynamics of eye fixations in the context of web-based visual world paradigm (VWP) experiments. The app provides a dynamic visualization tool for exploring how different data removal thresholds impact the distribution of eye fixations at crucial time points within the sentence structure.

## Features
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Allows users to interactively adjust data removal thresholds and observe their effects on eye fixation distribution.
- **Time Point Analysis**: Focus on four critical time points: beginning of the sentence, verb onset, object onset, and selection of visual stimuli.

## Usage
1. Open the app using the provided URL: [Eye Fixations Shiny App](https://adam-a-bramlett.shinyapps.io/Eye_Fixations_App/)
2. Adjust the sliders to set data removal thresholds.
3. Explore the impact of these adjustments on the distribution of eye fixations across different time points.
